Executing the C++ source file:

	1. Given the C++ source code files are in the zip file
	2. now we need to compile it using compiler
	3. we need to use g++ for compiling
	4. The compilation is to be done with "-o" and "-lpthread" for getting executable with desired name.
		g++ SrcAssgn4-CS19BTECH11039.cpp -lpthread -o <executable>
	5. now the compilation is done and the executable file is created with the given name.
	6. now running the executable file
		as the input file is named "input.txt", it is hardcoded in the code to take input from the file input.txt, so no need of passing any arguments.
		let exec be the executable file name, then
		./exec gives you all the files containing required data corresponding to the problem

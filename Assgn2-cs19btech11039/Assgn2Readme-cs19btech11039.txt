CS19BTECH11039 - SRI HARI

Executing the C++ source file:

	1. Given the C++ source code files are in the zip file
	2. now we need to compile it using compiler
	3. we need to use g++ for compiling
	4. The compilation is to be done with "-o" for getting executable with desired name.
		g++ Assgn-RMS-cs19btech11039.cpp -o <executable_name>
		g++ Assgn-EDF-cs19btech11039.cpp -o <executable_name>
		g++ Assgn-RMS-cs-cs19btech11039.cpp -o <executable_name>
		g++ Assgn-EDF-cs-cs19btech11039.cpp -o <executable_name>
	5. now the compilation is done and the executable file is created with the given name.
	7. now running the executable file
		as the input file is named "inp-params.txt", it is hardcoded in the code to take input from the file inp-params.txt, so no need of passing any arguments.
		let exec be the executable file name, then
		./exec gives you all the log file and stats file for each source code
